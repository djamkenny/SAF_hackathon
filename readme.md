=======================================================

In the context of agriculture, the process you've described can be referred to as "environmental parameter normalization" or "environmental data normalization." This process involves standardizing and scaling environmental parameters such as moisture, pH, nutrients, and temperature to a common range, typically between 0 and 1.

More specifically, you could refer to it as "environmental parameter standardization" in the context of agriculture, as it involves bringing diverse environmental parameters to a standardized scale for analysis, modeling, or decision-making in agricultural practices.

This type of normalization is particularly relevant in precision agriculture, where data-driven approaches are used to optimize crop yield, resource utilization, and environmental sustainability. By standardizing environmental parameters, agricultural practitioners and researchers can make more informed decisions based on the normalized data.
